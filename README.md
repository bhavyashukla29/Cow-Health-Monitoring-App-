# 🐄 THI Monitor - Smart Livestock Heat Stress Tracker

An Android app that calculates and visualizes the **Temperature-Humidity Index (THI)** for livestock, helping farmers monitor heat stress using both **manual inputs** and **real-time weather data**.  
Built with **Kotlin**, the app stores recent readings, plots a 7-day trend graph, and integrates a minimal **ML-based prediction** feature for smart farm management.
